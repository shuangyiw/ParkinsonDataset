# ParkinsonDataset
We searched for multiple Parkinsonâ€™s disease public datasets and divided them into three kinds: drawing, speech, and gait. 
The handdrawing dataset contains three subsets: [HandPD](http://wwwp.fc.unesp.br/~papa/pub/datasets/Handpd/), [NewHandPD]((http://wwwp.fc.unesp.br/~papa/pub/datasets/Handpd/)), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings).

The voice dataset contains two subsets: [ItalianVoice](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/italian-parkinsons-voice-and-speech) and [MDVR-KCL](https://zenodo.org/record/2867216#.ZCPnJnbP1PY).

The gait data contains two subsets [Ga](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/) and [Ju](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/).
