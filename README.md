# ParkinsonDataset
We searched for multiple Parkinsonâ€™s disease public datasets and divided them into three kinds: drawing, speech, and gait.   
The handdrawing dataset contains three subsets: [HandPD](http://wwwp.fc.unesp.br/~papa/pub/datasets/Handpd/), [NewHandPD](http://wwwp.fc.unesp.br/~papa/pub/datasets/Handpd/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings).

The voice dataset contains two subsets: [ItalianVoice](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/italian-parkinsons-voice-and-speech) and [MDVR-KCL](https://zenodo.org/record/2867216#.ZCPnJnbP1PY).

The gait data contains two subsets: [Ga](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/) and [Ju](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/).

For the handdrawing dataset, we used spirals and meanders graphs from all datasets to make sure the graph types are consistent, excluding circle images from NewHandPD and wave graphs from Kaggle. For ItalianVoice in the speech dataset, we excluded data from 15 healthy young people and two older healthy people with murmurs. Then three tasks with longer time were selected: reading speech-balanced text, sentences, and words. For the MDVR-KCL dataset, we used data from all people, but the voice recordings of the dataset contain white space and the voice of the staff, which interfere with the learning of the model. To only retain information that is valid for training, we cropped the irrelevant audio segments. Since the ItalianVoice dataset is sampled at 16 kHz, the MDVR-KCL voice signals were downsampled to 16 kHz before merging the datasets. Since each sound data is long and varies in length, each data is segmented, all data were normalized, and we set the segment length to 64005 with the overlap of 50% of the segment length.For the gait dataset, the first 10 seconds and the last 10 seconds of each data were removed to eliminate the transient effect. As with the speech dataset, we segmented the gait data and set the segment length to 1000 with an overlap of 50% of the segment length.


`handdrawing.zip`, voice.zip, and gait.zip store the three merged datasets respectively.
